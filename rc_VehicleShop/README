Thanks for buying my script!

How to install the script?
-> add in the server.cfg "start rc_VehicleShop"
-> import the sql file in your database


How to add more vehicles?
-> Go into the database of the script and just copy an existing line. 
There are 3 genres, bike, car, truck. 
Put your new line in such a way that the vehicle name matches your vehicle what you want
